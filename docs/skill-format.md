# Skill format

## On disk

A skill is a folder.

Required:

- `SKILL.md` (or `skill.md`)

Optional:

- any supporting _text-based_ files (see “Allowed files”)
- `.clawhubignore` (ignore patterns for publish/sync, legacy `.clawdhubignore`)
- `.gitignore` (also honored)

Local install metadata (written by the CLI):

- `<skill>/.clawhub/origin.json` (legacy `.clawdhub`)

Workdir install state (written by the CLI):

- `<workdir>/.clawhub/lock.json` (legacy `.clawdhub`)

## `SKILL.md`

- Markdown with optional YAML frontmatter.
- The server extracts metadata from frontmatter during publish.
- `description` is used as the skill summary in the UI/search.

## Frontmatter metadata

Skill metadata is declared in the YAML frontmatter at the top of your `SKILL.md`. This tells the registry (and security analysis) what your skill needs to run.

### Basic frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Short summary of what this skill does.
version: 1.0.0
---
```

### Runtime metadata (`metadata.openclaw`)

Declare your skill's runtime requirements under `metadata.openclaw` (aliases: `metadata.clawdbot`, `metadata.clawdis`).

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Manage tasks via the Todoist API.
metadata:
  openclaw:
    requires:
      env:
        - TODOIST_API_KEY
      bins:
        - curl
    primaryEnv: TODOIST_API_KEY
---
```

### Full field reference

| Field              | Type       | Description                                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `requires.env`     | `string[]` | Environment variables your skill expects.                       |
| `requires.bins`    | `string[]` | CLI binaries that must all be installed.                        |
| `requires.anyBins` | `string[]` | CLI binaries where at least one must exist.                     |
| `requires.config`  | `string[]` | Config file paths your skill reads.                             |
| `primaryEnv`       | `string`   | The main credential env var for your skill.                     |
| `always`           | `boolean`  | If `true`, skill is always active (no explicit install needed). |
| `skillKey`         | `string`   | Override the skill's invocation key.                            |
| `emoji`            | `string`   | Display emoji for the skill.                                    |
| `homepage`         | `string`   | URL to the skill's homepage or docs.                            |
| `os`               | `string[]` | OS restrictions (e.g. `["macos"]`, `["linux"]`).                |
| `install`          | `array`    | Install specs for dependencies (see below).                     |
| `nix`              | `object`   | Nix plugin spec (see README).                                   |
| `config`           | `object`   | Clawdbot config spec (see README).                              |

### Install specs

If your skill needs dependencies installed, declare them in the `install` array:

```yaml
metadata:
  openclaw:
    install:
      - kind: brew
        formula: jq
        bins: [jq]
      - kind: node
        package: typescript
        bins: [tsc]
```

Supported install kinds: `brew`, `node`, `go`, `uv`.

### Why this matters

ClawHub's security analysis checks that what your skill declares matches what it actually does. If your code references `TODOIST_API_KEY` but your frontmatter doesn't declare it under `requires.env`, the analysis will flag a metadata mismatch. Keeping declarations accurate helps your skill pass review and helps users understand what they're installing.

### Example: complete frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: todoist-cli
description: Manage Todoist tasks, projects, and labels from the command line.
version: 1.2.0
metadata:
  openclaw:
    requires:
      env:
        - TODOIST_API_KEY
      bins:
        - curl
    primaryEnv: TODOIST_API_KEY
    emoji: "\u2705"
    homepage: https://github.com/example/todoist-cli
---
```

## Allowed files

Only “text-based” files are accepted by publish.

- Extension allowlist is in `packages/schema/src/textFiles.ts` (`TEXT_FILE_EXTENSIONS`).
- Content types starting with `text/` are treated as text; plus a small allowlist (JSON/YAML/TOML/JS/TS/Markdown/SVG).

Limits (server-side):

- Total bundle size: 50MB.
- Embedding text includes `SKILL.md` + up to ~40 non-`.md` files (best-effort cap).

## Slugs

- Derived from folder name by default.
- Must be lowercase and URL-safe: `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`.

## Versioning + tags

- Each publish creates a new version (semver).
- Tags are string pointers to a version; `latest` is commonly used.

## License

- All skills published on ClawHub are licensed under `MIT-0`.
- Anyone may use, modify, and redistribute published skills, including commercially.
- Attribution is not required.
- Do not add conflicting license terms in `SKILL.md`; ClawHub does not support per-skill license overrides.
